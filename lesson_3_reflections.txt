When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Having a remote repository allows that more than 1 person can collaborate on the same repository 
    from different computers.It can also help in the case where I am the only developer, but I 
    use different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    By doing it manually I can control when I want to pull a change. 
    If I am doing some code, I do not want Git to automatically 
    pull new changes that might interfere with my work until I am 
    done with a logical change.
