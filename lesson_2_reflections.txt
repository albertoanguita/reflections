What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	You indicate git that you want to keep track of the future changes 
	of the files contained in it. You need to do it so git can 
	initialize the metadata associated to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory stores the local copies of my files, with the 
	latest changes that I introduced. The staging area stores the 
	last commit from my repository (or my latest changes, if I already 
	added them with "git add"). The 
	repository stores the latest files state that I committed (together 
	with all other commits). Having the staging area allows me to 
	review the changes since my last commit easily, and decide what 
	files to include in each commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Adding one logical change to the staging area and then doing the 
	commit for that change, before proceeding with next logical change.
